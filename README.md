Simple index.js For creating a bot embed. Very hardcoded though as i madde this in 2 minutes


To use this open the install_Packages.bat

Set const channelId = 'Channel_id'; to your channel id 

make the embed whatever you want. If you dont know how to create one i recomenned using https://discohook.org/ and after that scroll to the bottom of the page and press json data editor to copy your embed data. 
After that replace

client.login('Bot_token'); with your discord bot token. If you dont know how to create one look at this https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/ 

Then just open start.bat and enjoy
